###Rails 5 Practice

This is a practice/code along of Rails 5: The Tour.

This video can be found on http://rubyonrails.org/.

Great features of the new version of Rails, among others:
* rails db:migrate, rails db: seed (no more rake)
* Action Cable - uses Web Sockets via channels
* Mailer function

Before starting on The Tour, please visit http://railsapps.github.io/updating-rails.html for steps to update your Rails version to Rails 5

Twas fun! Looking forward to start using Rails 5 on my next project.
